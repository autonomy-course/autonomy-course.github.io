## path planning

## path planning

- determining **optimal trajectory** for autonomous vehicle 

---

## path planning

- determining **optimal trajectory** for autonomous vehicle 
- from current position to its **intended destination**

## path planning

- determining **optimal trajectory** for autonomous vehicle 
- from current position to its **intended destination**
- account for various factors 
    - road conditions, traffic laws, obstacles, potential hazards, _etc._
