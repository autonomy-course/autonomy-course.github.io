new challenges for system designers

---

makes analysis of **safety guarantees** that much harder! 

---

multiple standards proposed 

Note:
As the (hardware and software) functionality and complexities increase, the standards themselves will likely have to be updated. One point to highlight is that the _primary_ motivation of autonomous car technologies is reducing the frequency of traffic collisions.

**multiple standards** proposed 

**primary** motivation &rarr; reduce frequency of traffic collisions

first, we look **functional safety** requirements for autonomous systems

## Levels of Automation

---

[NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle-safety/automated-vehicles-safety#the-topic-safety-timeline) defines **five levels of automation** for vehicles

---


|level|description|responsibility|examples|
|:----|:-----|:-----|----|
| <scb>0</scb> | system provides **momentary** assistance &rarr; warnings, emergency interventions | **driver** | |

|level|description|responsibility|examples|

| <scb>1</scb> | system provides **continuous** assistance &rarr; acceleration/braking **or** steering| **driver** | 
||


<img src="img/safety/nhtsa.level.1.png" width="1100">

Note:
-  the system provides continuous assistance with either acceleration/braking **or** steering, while driver remains fully engaged and attentive. Driver is fully still responsible for driving the vehicle.

Note:
- If the system can no longer operate and prompts the driver, the driver must be available to resume all aspects of the driving task.

Note:
occupants act only as passengers and do not need to be engaged. A human driver is not needed to operate the vehicle.

Note:

This matches the "functional views" in software architectures -- code is clustered into groups and distributed to different teams in order to reason about them. It closely aligns with the [V Waterfall](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1764810.1764814) model of software development.

> "who is **liable** for the actions of the car?"

- the car **owner**?
- the car **manufacturer**?
- the **software/hardware developers**?
- the **city/state/federal governments**?
- someone else?

active area of research/discussion &rarr; especially in legal community

for existing liability laws must evolve

for existing liability laws must evolve 

identify remedies for **damage** and **injury**

particularly problematic for higher levels of autonomy (levels <scb>4</scb> and <scb>5</scb>)

various countries &rarr; drafting policies and laws

(UK, France, Germany, Japan, _etc._ )

efforts to gauge role of **ML/AI in autonomous systems**

tracking liability when such agents are making choices

Note:
. But since ML/AI is a fast moving field, developing new policies/laws is quite challenging.
