## the **wcet** problem

must consider &rarr; **all possible inputs**

---

## wcet | used to ensure...

- "_schedulability_"
- resource requirements 
- performance limits 

of embedded and real-time programs

---

## wcet approaches

lots of approaches to computing the WCET, _e.g.,_
- [dynamic/empirical](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~whalley/papers/tecs07.pdf) &rarr; run program lots of times  on the platform 
- [static](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~whalley/papers/tecs07.pdf) &rarr; _compile time_ analysis to compute the _worst-case paths_ 
- [hybrid](https://sibin.github.io/papers/2008_NCSU-Dissertation_CheckerMode_SibinMohan.pdf) &rarr; a combination of the two
- [probabilistic](https://people.ac.upc.edu/fcazorla/articles/jabella_ecrts2014_2.pdf) &rarr; combine dynamic analysis+statistical methods
- [ML-based methods](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3570361.3615740) &rarr; applying machine-learning to the problem

---

## so what's the "problem"?

---

## so what's the "problem"?

at a high-level, the execution time distributions of applications:

<img src="./img/embedded_arch/wcet_wilhelm.png" height="550" style="display: inline-block;" title="https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/es/PDFs/lecture_11.pdf" />

Note: we see that the various methods either underestimate or overestime the wcet. the former affects the safety, the latter wastes resources

---

### wcet analysis is a hard problem!

structural problems (in hardware/software) make it more difficult!

---

## consider this example

```c
void main()
{
    int max = 10 ;
    int sum = 0;
    for( int i = 0 ; i < max ; ++i)
        sum += i ;
}
```

---

## consider this example

```c
void main()
{
    int max = 10 ;
    int sum = 0;
    for( int i = 0 ; i < max ; ++i)
        sum += i ;
}
```

how do you compute the WCET for this code?

---

## need additional information

---

## need additional information

first, define the **processor** it runs on &rarr; say, "**P**"

---

## need additional information

first, define the **processor** it runs on &rarr; say, "**P**"
- how long each instruction takes to execute on P
- how many loop iterations?
- what is the startup/cleanup times for the program on P?  

---

### adding in all that information, we have...

```c [1|3|4|5-6|7]
void main()         // startup cost = 100 cycles
{
int max = 15 ;  // 10 cycles
int sum = 0;    // 10 cycles 
for( int i = 0 ; i < max ; ++i) // 5 cycles, once
sum += i ; // 20 cycles each iteration
}                   // cleanup cost = 120 cycles
```

---

### to calculate the wcet

```c
1   void main()         // startup cost = 100 cycles
2   {
3       int max = 15 ;  // 10 cycles
4       int sum = 0;    // 10 cycles 
5       for( int i = 0 ; i < max ; ++i) // 5 cycles, once
6            sum += i ; // 20 cycles each iteration
7   }                   // cleanup cost = 120 cycles
```


$$
wcet = line_1 + line_3 + line_4 + line_5 + (line_6 * max)
$$ 

---

### to calculate the wcet

```c
1   void main()         // startup cost = 100 cycles
2   {
3       int max = 15 ;  // 10 cycles
4       int sum = 0;    // 10 cycles 
5       for( int i = 0 ; i < max ; ++i) // 5 cycles, once
6            sum += i ; // 20 cycles each iteration
7   }                   // cleanup cost = 120 cycles
```


$$
wcet = line_1 + line_3 + line_4 + line_5 + (line_6 * max)
$$ 

which is fine for this simple example

---

Now consider this slight change to the above code:
```c [3]
void main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
    int max = atoi( argv[1] ) ;     // convert the command line arg to max
    int sum = 0; 
    for( int i = 0 ; i < max ; ++i) // how many iterations?
        sum += i ;
}
```

---

Now consider this slight change to the above code:
```c [3]
void main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
    int max = atoi( argv[1] ) ;     // convert the command line arg to max
    int sum = 0; 
    for( int i = 0 ; i < max ; ++i) // how many iterations?
        sum += i ;
}
```

previous equation **fails**!

---

Now consider this slight change to the above code:
```c [3]
void main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
    int max = atoi( argv[1] ) ;     // convert the command line arg to max
    int sum = 0; 
    for( int i = 0 ; i < max ; ++i) // how many iterations?
        sum += i ;
}
```

previous equation **fails**!

no longer know the value of `max` &rarr; arbitrary wcet!

---

let's make another change to the code:
```c [1-6|10-16]
#define VERY_LARGE_ARRAY+SIZE 1>>18

void main()
{
    int first_array[VERY_LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE] ;
    int second_array[VERY_LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE] ;

    int sum_first = 0;
    int sum_second = 0;
    for( int i = 0 ; i < VERY_LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE * 2 ; ++i)
    {
        if( i%2 )
            first_sum += first_array[i/2] ;
        else
            second_sum += second_array[(int)((i/2)+1)] ;
    }
}
```

---

let's make another change to the code:
```c [10-16]
#define VERY_LARGE_ARRAY+SIZE 1>>18

void main()
{
    int first_array[VERY_LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE] ;
    int second_array[VERY_LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE] ;

    int sum_first = 0;
    int sum_second = 0;
    for( int i = 0 ; i < VERY_LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE * 2 ; ++i)
    {
        if( i%2 )
            first_sum += first_array[i/2] ;
        else
            second_sum += second_array[(int)((i/2)+1)] ;
    }
}
```

can we compute wcet easily (using previous equation)?

**note:** maximum size of loop is known &rarr; `VERY_LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE * 2`

Note: pause and ask students what, if anything can go wrong?
