## **Lab 11** | Tuning EKF 

### Design of Autonomous Systems  
### CSCI 6907/4907 - Section 86  
### Prof. **Sibin Mohan**  
### Spring '25 | SEH 4040

---

## **Objectives**

- Understand the role of **Kalman Filters** in autonomous systems
- Learn how **Extended Kalman Filters (EKF)** improve estimation in nonlinear systems
- Explore **tuning strategies** for EKF using both empirical and systematic methods
- Simulate EKF to visualize effects of tuning

---

## **1. Introduction**

State estimation allows robots to track internal states despite noisy or incomplete observations

---

In this lab:
- We build on MP-3 where EKF was used with Navio sensors
- We dive deeper into **EKF** and how to **tune it** for optimal performance

---

## **2. Kalman Filter Basics**

Kalman Filters perform two main steps:

1. **Prediction**: Estimate next state using the model
2. **Correction**: Update estimate using sensor data

---

### Key Terms
- **State vector (x)**: Quantities like position, velocity
- **Process model**: Defines how the state evolves
- **Measurement model**: Maps sensor data to state
- **Q**: Process noise covariance
- **R**: Measurement noise covariance

---

## **3. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**

Used for **nonlinear** systems. Linearizes the system at current estimate

### 3.1 State Prediction
```
x̂ₖ|ₖ₋₁ = f(x̂ₖ₋₁|ₖ₋₁, uₖ₋₁)
```
- `f`: Nonlinear process model
- `uₖ₋₁`: Control input

---

### 3.2 Covariance Prediction
```
Pₖ|ₖ₋₁ = Fₖ Pₖ₋₁|ₖ₋₁ Fₖᵀ + Qₖ
```
- `Fₖ`: Jacobian of `f`

---

## **3.3 Measurement Update**

**Innovation**:
```
ẏₖ = zₖ - h(x̂ₖ|ₖ₋₁)
```
**Innovation Covariance**:
```
Sₖ = Hₖ Pₖ|ₖ₋₁ Hₖᵀ + Rₖ
```

---

**Kalman Gain**:
```
Kₖ = Pₖ|ₖ₋₁ Hₖᵀ Sₖ⁻¹
```
**State & Covariance Update**:
```
x̂ₖ|ₖ = x̂ₖ|ₖ₋₁ + Kₖ ẏₖ
Pₖ|ₖ = (I - Kₖ Hₖ) Pₖ|ₖ₋₁
```

## **4. Tuning Kalman Filters**

Goal: Choose the best Q and R to balance model trust vs sensor trust

---

### 4.1 Noise Covariance Matrices
- **Q (Process Noise)**: Higher → less model trust
- **R (Measurement Noise)**: Higher → less sensor trust

---

### 4.2 Empirical Tuning

**Trial-and-error** approach:
- Start with small values for Q and R
- Tune based on performance/behavior

- **Pros**: Simple  
- **Cons**: Time-consuming, suboptimal

---

### 4.3 Systematic Tuning

- **Statistical analysis**: Estimate noise from logs
- **Parameter identification tools** (e.g. MATLAB)
- **Offline simulation** to optimize RMSE

---

## **5. Simulating EKF**

Before hardware deployment, simulate EKF to understand tuning effects.

---

**Online Simulators**:
- [Wolfram EKF Tuning Demo](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TuningAnExtendedKalmanFilter/)
- Visualize effect of Q and R

---

## **6. Demo: Tuning EKF**

---

## **7. Summary**

- EKF is critical for nonlinear state estimation
- Tuning Q and R is vital for good performance
- Use both empirical and systematic methods
- Simulators help visualize and debug EKF behavior
