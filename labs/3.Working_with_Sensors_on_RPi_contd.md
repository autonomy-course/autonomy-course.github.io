## **Lab 3** | Understanding and Using IMU Data on Navio2 Board [contd.]

### Design of Autonomous Systems  
### CSCI 6907/4907 - Section 86  
### Prof. **Sibin Mohan**

---

## **Objectives**

- Understand the working of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)  
- Read real-time IMU data from Navio2 board  
- Plot and analyze IMU data using Python

---

## **What is an IMU?**

IMU stands for **Inertial Measurement Unit**, a sensor module used for measuring motion and orientation

---

### **Components of an IMU**
- **Accelerometer**: Measures acceleration in X, Y, Z axes
- **Gyroscope**: Measures angular velocity or rotational speed
- **Magnetometer**: Detects magnetic fields and acts as a compass

---

### **Applications of IMUs**
- Stability in drones and robots
- Navigation in self-driving vehicles
- Orientation tracking in smartphones

---

## **Lab Equipment**

- Raspberry Pi with Navio2 shield
- MicroSD Card (32GB or larger)
- SSH-enabled device for remote access
- Python 3 installed with necessary libraries

---

## **Part 1: Reading IMU Values**

### **Setup Steps**
1. **Prepare Hardware:**
   - Mount the Navio2 shield on the Raspberry Pi
   - Power the Raspberry Pi and access it via SSH

2. **Install Libraries:**
   Use the following commands to update your system and install necessary Python libraries. For detailed instructions, refer to the GitHub

3. **Python Script:**
   Create a script to read IMU data. Script details are available on the GitHub

## **Part 1: Reading IMU Values**

4. **Run Script:**
   Execute the Python script as instructed in the repository

5. **Observe:** IMU data for accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer is displayed in real-time

---

## **Part 2: Plotting IMU Data**

### **Steps to Visualize Data**
1. **Install Matplotlib:**
   Use the command from the GitHub to install Matplotlib

2. **Update Script for Plotting:**
   Modify the script to include data plotting functionality. The full script is available in the GitHub

3. **Run Script:**
   Execute the updated script to collect and plot data

4. **Observe:** A plot of accelerometer data over time is displayed

---

## **Lab Assignment**

1. Show the TAs the plotted graph.

2. Submit a plot of accelerometer data collected from a Raspberry Pi swinging like a pendulum.

---

## **Summary**

- Learned the fundamentals of IMU sensors
- Collected real-time IMU data from Navio2 board
- Visualized accelerometer data using Python and Matplotlib
