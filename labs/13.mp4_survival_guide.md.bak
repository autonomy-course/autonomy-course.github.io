## 1. Why you should worry about batteries!!

Battery fires are really bad! ⚠️

- They’re not extinguishable!  
- Fire extinguishers won’t work—they don’t need oxygen to burn  
- Their heat can melt most stuff  
- Toxic fumes—**never inhale** them!

---

**golden rules**:  

- Never let battery drop below **10%**  
- Check battery level every **10–15 minutes**  
- Set timers ⏳ if you have to

---

## 2. How to know if my battery is good?

- Put battery on a **flat surface** and check if it **spins**  
  - If yes &rarr; **swollen** &rarr; **don’t use it **!
- A good battery is **never warm** 
  - Warm = danger &rarr; **Call TA immediately**

---

## 3. What to do if it’s on fire/warm/bulging?

- Call a TA **immediately**  
- Avoid inhaling fumes  
- Don’t play hero — stay away from fire  
- Place in sand bucket if possible (we will provide it!)

## **4. Objectives of MP4**

MP4 is divided into 3 parts:  

- **Part 1**: Assemble & test the rover  
- **Part 2**: Write the **control algorithm**  
- **Part 3**: Write **waypoint file**  
  - Also: object detection, stop sign & traffic light detection

---

## **5. Part 1: Assembling**

- Easy 
- Most of you have already done this

---

## **6. Part 2: Control Algorithm**

Think of it in 4 steps:  

1. Calculate **error terms** PID will minimize 
  - \eg distance from next waypoint
2. Write the **PID class**  
3. Test rover with **existing waypoint** to make square  
4. Tune your PID

---

## **7. Part 3: Writing Waypoints**

3 sub-tasks:  
1. Write waypoints that **actually work**  
2. Add **object detection**  
3. Add **traffic light/sign** detection  
   - Don’t check them **too frequently**

## **8. Fin**

Stay safe, build smart, and ask for help when needed.
