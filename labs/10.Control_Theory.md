## **Lab 10** | Control Theory/Controlling Rover

### Design of Autonomous Systems  
### CSCI 6907/4907 - Section 86  
### Prof. **Sibin Mohan**

---

## **Objectives**

- Understand the fundamentals of **control theory** and its role in autonomous systems.
- Learn how to implement a **PID controller** for controlling an autonomous rover.
- Apply control theory to navigate the rover using **Navio2** and **Raspberry Pi**.
- Test and validate the control system in a simulated or real-world environment.

---

## **1. Introduction**

Control theory is a fundamental aspect of autonomous systems, enabling precise control over a system's behavior

---

In this lab:
- Learn the basics of control theory
- Implement a PID controller
- Apply it to a real rover using **Navio2 + Raspberry Pi**
- Use **Python 2** and **ROS**

---

## **2. Control Theory Basics**

Control theory governs how systems respond to inputs.
It enables:
- **Motion control**
- **Error correction**
- **System stability**

---

### **2.1 Open-Loop vs Closed-Loop Control**

- **Open-Loop**: No feedback; outputs are not measured
  - Example: Pre-programmed motor speeds
- **Closed-Loop**: Uses feedback to adjust inputs
  - Example: Adjusting motor based on encoder data

---

### **2.2 PID Controller**

**PID = Proportional + Integral + Derivative**

Used for precise control using feedback.

---

**Components**:
- **P** (Proportional): Corrects current error
- **I** (Integral): Corrects accumulated past error
- **D** (Derivative): Predicts future error

---

## **3. Implementing a PID Controller**

**PID Output Equation**:

```
u(t) = Kp * e(t) + Ki * âˆ«â‚€áµ— e(Ï„)dÏ„ + Kd * de(t)/dt
```

Where:
- `e(t)` = error at time `t`
- `Kp`, `Ki`, `Kd` = tuning gains

---

### **3.1 PID Controller Equations**

- **P** = Kp * e(t)
- **I** = Ki * âˆ«â‚€áµ— e(Ï„)dÏ„
- **D** = Kd * de(t)/dt

**Combined Control Output**:
```
u(t) = P + I + D
```

---

### **3.2 Tuning PID Parameters**

- **Manual Tuning**
  - Start with Kp
  - Add Ki to reduce steady-state error
  - Add Kd to reduce overshoot

- **Ziegler-Nichols Method**
  - Empirical method to get initial gain estimates

---

## **4. Simulating and Testing PID**

Before deploying:
- Test using a PID simulator
- Understand behavior for various gain values

## **5. Summary**

- Control theory enables precise autonomous behavior.
- PID controllers are widely used for feedback control.
- Gain tuning is critical for balance between response and stability.
- Simulators are valuable tools for verification before real-world testing.
