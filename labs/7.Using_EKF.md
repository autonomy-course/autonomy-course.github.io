### Design of Autonomous Systems  
### CSCI 6907/4907 - Section 86  
### Prof. **Sibin Mohan**

---

## **Objectives**

- Understand different **steering models** and their role in autonomous navigation.
- Analyze **kinematic and dynamic reachability** and their impact on motion planning.
- Learn about the **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** and its importance in localization.
- Implement EKF for real-world robotic applications using **ROS**.

## **1. Introduction to Steering Models**

Autonomous systems rely on precise motion planning and localization techniques to navigate complex environments. 

we explore three primary steering models

- Ackermann
- Differential Drive
- Omnidirectional

while analyzing their role in motion planning and reachability

---

### **Key Steering Models**
- **Ackermann Steering Model** - Used in four-wheeled vehicles, ensuring smooth turns.
- **Differential Drive Model** - Common in mobile robots, allowing in-place rotation.
- **Omnidirectional Steering Model** - Enables movement in any direction.

---

## **2. Reachability in Motion Planning**

### **Kinematic Reachability**
Defines the set of positions a robot can reach based purely on its steering constraints, without considering velocity, acceleration, or environmental factors.

---

### **Dynamic Reachability**
Expands upon kinematic reachability by incorporating **velocity, acceleration, and slip** constraints. This is crucial in real-world motion planning where friction, actuator limitations, and inertia play a role.

---

## **3. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for Localization**

### **Why Use EKF?**
Localization is a critical challenge in robotics, where a robot must estimate its position and orientation in an environment. Sensors such as IMUs, GPS, and LiDAR provide noisy data, and the **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** refines this data for accurate localization.

---

### **EKF Process**
1. **Prediction Step:**
   ```math
   x_t = f(x_{t-1}, u_t) + w_t
   ```
2. **Update Step:**
   ```math
   z_t = h(x_t) + v_t
   ```

## **4. Implementing Ackermann Steering in the Rover**

### **Part 1: Setup and ROS Package Creation**

#### **Setup Your Environment**
- Ensure **ROS (Noetic)** is installed on your Raspberry Pi.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ros-noetic-rosserial ros-noetic-joy ros-noetic-ackermann-msgs
  ```

---

- Clone or create a ROS package for steering:
  ```bash
  cd ~/catkin_ws/src
  catkin_create_pkg ackermann_steering std_msgs rospy geometry_msgs ackermann_msgs
  ```

---

#### **Develop a Steering Controller Node**
- Implement a **ROS node** that:
  - Subscribes to `/cmd_vel`.
  - Calculates **inner and outer wheel angles** using Ackermann equations.
  - Publishes angles to a **servo motor controlling front wheels**.
  - Drives **rear wheels using PWM or motor driver commands**.

---

### **Part 2: PWM Control and Testing**

#### **Setup PWM Control for Steering and Throttle**
- **Servo Steering:**
  - Use **Navio's PWM outputs** to control the steering servo.
  - Map the **steering angles to servo PWM values**.

- **Motor Control:**
  - Use **Navioâ€™s PWM** to control the motor driver.
  - Convert speed commands to **throttle PWM values**

---

#### **Test Steering & Motion**
- **Run ROS Node:**
  ```bash
  rosrun ackermann_steering steering_controller.py
  ```
- **Publish Test Commands:**
  ```bash
  rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "{linear: {x: 1.0}, angular: {z: 0.5}}"
  ```
  This should move the rover **forward with a turn**.

---

## **5. Summary**

- **Ackermann steering** is efficient but lacks lateral movement.
- **Differential drive** allows rotation but cannot strafe.
- **Omnidirectional robots** have the highest flexibility but require complex control.
- **EKF improves localization** by fusing sensor data to reduce noise and uncertainty.
