## 1. Why you should worry about batteries!!

Battery fires are really bad! ⚠️

- They’re not extinguishable!  
- Fire extinguishers won’t work—they don’t need oxygen to burn  
- Their heat can melt most stuff  
- Toxic fumes—**never inhale** them!

---

**golden rules**:  

- Never let battery drop below **10%**  
- Check battery level every **10–15 minutes**  
- Set timers ⏳ if you have to

---

## 2. How to know if my battery is good?

- Put battery on a **flat surface** and check if it **spins**  
  - If yes &rarr; **swollen** &rarr; **don’t use it**!
- A good battery is **never warm**

  <tr>
    <td>warm &rarr; <b>danger!</b> call TA immediately! </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 3. What to do if it’s on fire/warm/bulging?

- Call a TA **immediately**  
- Avoid inhaling fumes  
- Don’t play hero — stay away from fire  
- Place in sand bucket if possible (we will provide it!)

    <td>no TA? call <b>GW Environmental Safety</b> &rarr; (202) 994-4347 </td>

## 4. Objectives of MP4

MP4 is divided into 3 parts:  

- **Part 1**: Assemble & test the rover  
- **Part 2**: Write the **control algorithm**  
- **Part 3**: Write **waypoint file**  
  - Also: object detection, stop sign & traffic light detection

---

## 5. Part 1: Assembling

- Easy 
- Most of you have already done this

---

## 6. Part 2: Control Algorithm

consider the following **four** steps:  

- Calculate **error terms** PID will minimize 
  - _e.g.,_  distance from next waypoint
- Write the **PID class**  
- Test rover with **existing waypoint** to make square  
- Tune your PID

---

## 7. Part 3: Writing Waypoints

3 sub-tasks:  
1. Write waypoints that **actually work**  
2. Add **object detection**  
3. Add **traffic light/sign** detection  
   - Don’t check them **too frequently**

## 8. Fin

Stay safe, build smart and **ask for help** when needed!
